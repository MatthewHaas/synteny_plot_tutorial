# synteny_plot_tutorial

This tutorial is meant for members of the Kimball Lab at the University of Minnesota (Northern Wild Rice Conservation and Breeding) to understand how I made synteny plots using MCscan. The original tutorial by the author (Haibao Tang) can be found [here](https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/wiki/MCscan-%28Python-version%29). This is an excellent resource (and is where I learned how to use the program). The tutorial given here is more focused on the needs of our program.
